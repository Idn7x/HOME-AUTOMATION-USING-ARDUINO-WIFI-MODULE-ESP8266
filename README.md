# HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-ARDUINO-WIFI-MODULE-ESP8266
This project presents a design and prototype implementation of new home 
automation system that uses WiFi technology as a network infrastructure 
connecting its parts. The proposed system consists of two main components; the 
first part is the server (web server), which presents system core that 
manages, controls, and monitors usersâ€™ home.<br /> 
<br />
The project aims at designing an advanced home automation system using normal 
web server and Wi-Fi technology. The devices can be switched ON/OFF and 
sensors can be read using a Personal Computer (PC) through Wi-Fi.
<br /><br />
Users and system administrator can locally (LAN) or remotely (internet) 
manage and control system code. Second part is hardware interface module, 
which provides appropriate interface to sensors and actuator of home 
automation system.
